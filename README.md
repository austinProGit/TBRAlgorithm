# TBRAlgorithm
This code is designed to implement the TBRAlgorithm. This algorithm attempts to detect a long upstream SSH connection by 
calculating the standard deviation between keystroke-generated typing packets and comparing them to known standard deviations
between typing packets in short upstream connections. As of 4/6/2022, this algorithm is still in the experimental phase.
